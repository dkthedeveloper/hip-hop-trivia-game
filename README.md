# Project Guidance Recommendations
1. Review the minimum requirements for this assessment.
2. Plan what the user experience should be.
   - What should they see first?
   - What should they interact with first?
   - What do we expect them to see/touch next?
   - etc.
3. Take notes on what you think should happen behind the scenes (in the code) in order to make the user experience happen.
   - Maybe include some pseudo-code.
4. Determine what your Minimal Viable Product (MVP) should be. This is basically Version 0.5. (This version should be submitable for a full grade â€“ the "Minimal Gradable Product".) And determine what your "stretch goals" will be. These are extra features that can be added once the initial working version is complete.
   - Identify which features MUST be in the final product and which features MAY be in the final product.
   - Stretch Goals might include CSS styling, animations, full grid, full game, mobile-friendliness, other APIs, other endpoints from the jService API, etc.
   - MAKE A GIT COMMIT containing your finished MVP ("version 0.1"), so that you could always submit it, if needed. So the pressure is off.
5. Answers are logged in the console.
